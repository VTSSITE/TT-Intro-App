<h1>Intro App</h1>
<p>Your task is to modify ONLY the <b>"app.stache"</b> and <b>"app.js"</b> files in order to wire up the required functionality. You will have to use Google to learn what you do not know about CanJS.</p>
<p>The user is expected to enter a contact's information into the text boxes and then click the "Add Contact" button, which should append the contact to the table and clear the text boxes.</p>
<p>The contents of the table already provided are just an example of what you should see.</p>
<p>Do not use jQuery or manually manipulate the DOM in any way.</p>
